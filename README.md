# The Money Tree

**[How to play](#how-to-play) | [Example](#example-playthrough) | [Referrals](#referral-system) | [FAQ](#faq)**

The Money Tree is a game where your capital grows by +1% each minute, but there is a small chance of fire that burns the whole tree.

## How to play

1. Start a new game.
1. Add seed investment (your starting money).
1. Click "Grow".
1. Watch your seed investment grow by +1% per minute.
1. Click "Harvest" to withdraw your money.

Note: your tree may catch fire. In this case, you will have 5 minutes to extinguish the fire by adding more liquidity. If you don't extinguish the fire, the tree will burn down. If you extinguish the fire successfully, you can continue playing (and watch your capital grow even faster).
